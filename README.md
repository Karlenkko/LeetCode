### To myself:
Please be diligent and intelligent.   
Please try to leave useful comments.  
Please respect the naming rules of the files:  
	*e.g. 1.TwoSum/two_sum.py*   
Please keep being inspired. Try to think about the complexity of every possible implementation of an algorithm.  
Notice that the time and the memory consumed come from:  
	<a href="https://leetcode-cn.com/" target="_blank">Leetcode-cn</a>  
	or  
	<a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>    
~~Normally the chinese website gives a worse time as well as a worse memory consumption.~~  
~~But the percentile ranking can be higher than that in the US site.~~  
Anyway, this is merely a reference. So don't take it serious.  
Though a recursive way does not always give the best performance, do remember that:

Treat this readme.md as an exercise for markdown grammar
